 Problem Statement - The main method calls the subsequent methods
                     for setting up and running the two-player
                     guessing game.

 Design approach -
 
 Program execution will begin from Picture.java class. It will take ASCII image of super hero and super hero name as a argument for both the player.
 FileReader class will read the ASCII image file and store it in vector for both players. 
 Picture.java includes the method playGame(), that will start/end the game if it draws and method init() that will initialize player objects with default/start up values.
 
 The actual game will be controlled from Game.java class playerGame() method.
 All display related tasks are handled by Display.java class methods.
 
 Player.java class is a plain old java object [POJO] and includes player details like info, name to guess etc.
 All the constants used in the program are included in Constants.java class.
 
 Control flow -
 
 Player -> Picture.java -> FileReader.java 
 
                        -> Game.java         -> Display.java
		   
		                ->Player.java
						->Constants.java
