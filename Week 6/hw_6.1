  Design approach -
  
  Program execution willl begin from Test.java class, if the output is different from expected output, error message will be displayed on console.
  Else no output will be displayed.
  
  Node.java - In our node, we are storing a value of 'Object' datatype. Thus, it can store either of the three types - String, Integer and Long. It also implements Comparable interface.
  While overriding the compareTo method, the instance of the object is checked against the class of value object in the tree.
  
  SortedStorageSetWithNulls.java implements all the methods declared in the interface BinarySearchTree.java and creates bst of node objects from Node.java
